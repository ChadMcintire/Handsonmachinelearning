Since the ROC curve is so similar to the precision/recall (PR) curve, you may 
wonder how to decide which one to use. As a rule of thumb, you should prefer 
the PR curve whenever the positive class is rare or when you care more about 
the false positives than the false negatives. Otherwise, use the ROC curve. 
For example, looking at the previous ROC curve (and the ROC AUC score), 
you may think that the classifier is really good. But this is mostly 
because there are few positives (5s) compared to the negatives (non-5s). 
In contrast, the PR curve makes it clear that the classifier has room 
for improvement (the curve could be closer to the top-right corner).
