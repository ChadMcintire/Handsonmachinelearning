Numpy ravel():

ravel() function simply returns a flattened view/reference of Numpy array.

If you try to modify the flattened view then you end up with that same change in the original array.

ravel() does not occupy memory so we can say that it is faster than flatten()

library level function

Numpy flatten()

flatten() function returns a flattened copy of Numpy array.

Changes made to flattened array is not reflected back to the original array.

flatten() occupies memory so it is considered slower than ravel() function.

Flatten is a method of an ndarray object.
