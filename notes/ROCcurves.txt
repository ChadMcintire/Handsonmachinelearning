1. It shows the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity (any increase in sensitivity will be accompanied by a decrease in specificity).
2. The closer the curve follows the left-hand border and then the top border of the ROC space, the more accurate the test.
3. The closer the curve comes to the 45-degree diagonal of the ROC space, the less accurate the test.
4. The slope of the tangent line at a cutpoint gives the likelihood ratio (LR) for that value of the test. 
   You can check this out on the graph above. Recall that the LR for T4 < 5 is 52. This corresponds to the 
   far left, steep portion of the curve. The LR for T4 > 9 is 0.2. This corresponds to the far right, 
   nearly horizontal portion of the curve.
5. The area under the curve is a measure of text accuracy.

Once again there is a trade-off: the higher the recall (TPR), the more false positives (FPR) the classifier produces.

The 45' line represents a purely random classifier.

The closer the area under the curve is to 1 the better the classifier
